Ha a little late on the donation. This was my first GDQ experience. Loved the great community and support I saw watching some of my favorite games...Zelda OOT! My father experienced a cancer scare last fall. Luckily the tumor was taken out before any damage done. I look forward to the next GDQ!, 22.22
Sad I missed this AGDQ, I never thought I would miss it. I want to help still, so take my money and thank you all for this wonderful event! See you at SGDQ 2018!, 10.00

This donation is in honor of my beloved cat Ninja. He passed away after 10 years due to cancerous tumor. I hope some of this money will one day cure cancer so no one else will have to suffer losing a loved family member., 30.00

The event is over, and no one will read this, but it's important to me. Firstly, the event is incredible and serves not only the gaming community, but also the world and science and health at large. It's a beautiful thing. Let's knock out cancer for good.  Secondly, the event now corresponds with every six month milestone in my daughter's life. Last sgdq she was only about a week old - she's now a little over six months and thriving so well.  Here's my donation to her future and the future of all GDQs to share with her and my amazing wife., 25.00
